<h2>LETTERS FROM A D&Eacute;BUTANTE.</h2>

<p>My Dear <span class="smcap">Marjorie</span>,&mdash;You remember <span class="smcap">Cecil Cashmore</span>? Of course no theatricals
could be a success unless he took the entire management. He is a
celebrated private performer, and his name is frequently seen in
"Amateur Dramatic Notes," where he is freely compared to <span class="smcap">Coquelin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Arthur Roberts</span>, <span class="smcap">Irving</span>, and <span class="smcap">Charles Kean</span>, in his earlier manner&mdash;I mean
<span class="smcap">Charles Keane's</span> earlier manner, not <span class="smcap">Cecil's</span>. He always greets me with,
"Oh, I'm so afraid of you. I believe you're very cross with me"; and his
parting words are invariably "<i>Good</i>-bye; I'm coming to see you <i>so</i>
soon!" <span class="smcap">Cissy</span>&mdash;everyone calls him <span class="smcap">Cissy</span>&mdash;seems to be a little particular,
not to say fidgetty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby Beaumont</span> heard him say to his valet, "Take away that
eau-de-cologne&mdash;it's corked." He seems to think himself ill, though he
looks blooming; and says he has neurasthenia. He's always going through
some "course," or "treatment." One hears him cry to the footman who
hands him a forbidden dish, "Good Heavens, my dear man, don't offer me
<i>that</i>&mdash;I'm under <span class="smcap">Jowles</span>!"</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<a href="images/193b.png">
<img src="images/193b.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>We wanted to act <i>The School for Scandal</i>, but <span class="smcap">Cissy</span> has persuaded us to
get up a burlesque of his own&mdash;<i>Red Riding Hood</i>. I am to be <i>Red Riding
Hood</i>!!! I am delighted. I have never acted before; but they say I have
only to trip on with a basket. <span class="smcap">Baby</span> declared he would be a Proud Sister.
In vain he was told there were no Proud Sisters in <i>Red Riding Hood;</i> he
seemed to have set his heart on it so much that <span class="smcap">Cissy</span> has written one in
for him. Now <span class="smcap">Baby</span> is happy, designing himself a gorgeous frock, and
passing hours in front of a looking-glass, trying various patterns
against his complexion. All the strength of the piece falls upon <span class="smcap">Cissy</span>,
who plays the <i>Wolf</i>, and has given himself any amount of songs and
dances, lots of "serious interest," and all the "comic relief." He says
it's not an ordinary burlesque, but a mixture of a problem play and a
comic opera. Captain <span class="smcap">Mashington</span> is to play the Mother, so I see a good
deal of him. (The <span class="smcap">Lorne Hoppers</span> are in Scotland). We had had sixteen
rehearsals when <span class="smcap">Lady Taymer</span> suddenly horrified us by saying it seemed so
much trouble&mdash;why not give it up, and if we wanted a little fun, black
our faces and pretend to be niggers!! Of course, we would not listen to
her. I hear Captain <span class="smcap">Mashington</span> rehearsing his part every morning,
quietly, in the billiard-room. He never can remember the lines</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good bye, my dear, now mind you're very good,</span>
<span class="i0">And shun the dangers lurking in the wood."</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="noid">He thinks the mother ought to kiss <i>Red Riding Hood</i> before she starts.
<i>I</i> think <i>not</i>. We asked <span class="smcap">Cissy</span>. He says it's optional.... <span class="smcap">Cissy</span> rose
with the owl to-day, and said he was not well. A little later he came
and told us complacently that he had been looking it up in the
Encyclopedia, and found he had "every symptom of <i>acute</i>
lead-poisoning." He added that there was nothing to be done.</p>

<p>"I thought there was something wrong with you yesterday," said <span class="smcap">Baby</span>.
"You declined all nourishment between lunch and tea."</p>

<p>"By the way," said <span class="smcap">Cissy</span>, pretending not to hear, "<span class="smcap">Mashington</span> really is
not quite light enough for the Mother. You should persuade him to go
through a course, Miss <span class="smcap">Gladys</span>."</p>

<p>"He's just been through a course," I said, "at Hythe."</p>

<p>"My dear lady, I don't mean musketry. He ought to consult <span class="smcap">Castle Jones</span>,
the specialist. No soup, no bread, no potatoes&mdash;saccharine. What are
<i>you</i> allowed?" turning to <span class="smcap">Baby</span>, who was sitting on a window seat eating
<i>marrons-glacés</i> out of a paper-bag.</p>

<p>This sight seemed to infuriate our manager. He made a wild dart at <span class="smcap">Baby</span>,
saying, "Oh, look at this; it's fatal, positively fatal!" snatched
violently at the bag, secured a chestnut, and calmly walked out of the
room eating it and saying it was delicious.</p>

<p>I had just come home from a very nice drive with <span class="smcap">Jack</span>&mdash;I mean Captain
<span class="smcap">Mashington</span>&mdash;when I found a letter from <span class="smcap">Oriel</span>. He says he is engaged to
Miss <span class="smcap">Toogood</span>. The matter is to be kept a profound secret for the
present.... He asks me, <i>for the sake of the past</i>, to try and get him a
stamp of the Straits Settlements, in exchange for a Mauritian.... She
collects stamps too&mdash;it must have been the bond of union.... How fickle
men are! It's enough to disgust one with human nature. I know I broke it
off, but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="i2">
Ever your loving friend, <span class="author smcap">Gladys</span>.</p>

<p>I wonder if Miss <span class="smcap">Toogood</span> will have a bangle. I should like to advise her
not to have it <i>rivetted on</i>. It's such a bother getting them filed off.

<h2>LYRE AND LANCET.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">PART XVII.&mdash;A BOMB SHELL.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXVI.</span>&mdash;<i>A Gallery near the Verney Chamber.</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>About</i> 10.30
<span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><i>Spurrell</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I must say it's rather rough luck on that
poor devil. I get his dress suit, and all <i>he</i> gets is my booby-trap!
(<span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>wearing a holland blouse over her evening toilette,
approaches from the other end of the passage; he does not recognise her
until the moment of collision</i>.) <span class="smcap">Emma!!</span> It's never <i>you</i>! How do you
come to be <i>here</i>?</p>

<p><i>Phillipson</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Then it <i>was</i> my <span class="smcap">Jem</span> after all! (<i>Aloud,
distantly.</i>) I'm here in attendance on Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span>, being her maid.
If I was at all curious&mdash;which I'm not&mdash;I might ask you what <i>you're</i>
doing in such a house as this; and in evening dress, if you please!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I'm in evening dress, <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, such as it is (not that I've any
right to find fault with it); but I'm in evening dress (<i>with dignity</i>)
because I've been included in the dinner party here.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> You must have been getting on since <i>I</i> knew you. Then you were
studying to be a horse-doctor.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I <i>have</i> got on. I am now a qualified M.R.C.V.S.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> And does that qualify you to dine with bishops and countesses
and baronets and the gentry, like one of themselves?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I don't say it does, in itself. It was my <i>Andromeda</i> that did
the trick, <span class="smcap">Emma</span>.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> <i>Andromeda?</i> They were talking of that downstairs. What's made
you take to scribbling, <span class="smcap">James</span>?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Scribbling? how do you mean? My handwriting's easy enough to
read, as you ought to know very well.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> You can't expect me to remember what your writing's like; it's
so long since I've seen it!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Come, I like that! When I wrote twice to say I was sorry we'd
fallen out; and never got a word back!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> If you'd written to the addresses I gave you abroad&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Then you <i>did</i> write; but none of the letters reached me. I
never even knew you'd <i>gone</i> abroad. I wrote to the old place. And so
did you, I suppose, not knowing I'd moved my lodgings too, so
naturally&mdash;&mdash; But what does it all matter so long as we've met and it's
all right between us? Oh, my dear girl, if you only knew how I'd worried
myself, thinking you were&mdash;&mdash; Well, all that's over now, isn't it?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He attempts to embrace her.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>repulsing him</i>). Not quite so fast, <span class="smcap">James</span>. Before I say
whether we're to be as we were or not, I want to know a little more
about you. You wouldn't be here like this if you hadn't done <i>something</i>
to distinguish yourself.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Well, I don't say I mayn't have got a certain amount of what
they call "kudos," owing to <i>Andromeda</i>. But what difference does that
make?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Tell me, <span class="smcap">James</span>, is it <i>you</i> that's been writing a pink book all
over silver cutlets?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Me? Write a book&mdash;about cutlets&mdash;or anything else! <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, you
don't suppose I've quite come to that! <i>Andromeda</i>'s the name of my
bull-dog. I took first prize with her; there were portraits of both of
us in one of the papers. And the people here were very much taken with
the dog, and&mdash;and so they asked me to dine with them. That's how it was.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> I should have thought, if they asked one of you to dine, it
ought to have been the bull-dog.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Now what's the good of saying extravagant things of that sort?
Not that old <i>Drummy</i> couldn't be trusted to behave anywhere!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Better than her master, I daresay. <i>I</i> heard of your goings on
with some Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span> or other!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Oh, the girl I sat next to at dinner? Nice chatty sort of girl;
seems fond of quadrupeds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Especially two-legged ones! You see I've been told all about
it!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> I assure you I didn't go a step beyond the most ordinary
civility. You're not going to be jealous because I promised I'd give her
a liniment for one of her dogs, are you?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Liniment! You always <i>were</i> a flirt, <span class="smcap">James</span>! But I'm not
jealous. I've met a very nice-spoken young man while I've been here; he
sat next to me at supper, and paid me the most beautiful compliments,
and was most polite and attentive&mdash;though he hasn't got as far as
liniment, at present.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> But, <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, you're not going to take up with some other fellow
just when we've come together again?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> If you call it "coming together," when I'm down in the
Housekeeper's Room, and you're up above, carrying on with ladies of
title!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Do you want to drive me frantic? As if I could help being where
I am! How could I know <i>you</i> were here?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> At all events you know <i>now</i>, <span class="smcap">James</span>. And it's for you to choose
between your smart lady-friends and me. If you're fit company for them,
you're too grand for one of their maids.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> My dear girl, don't be unreasonable! I'm expected back in the
Drawing Room, and I <i>can't</i> throw 'em over now all of a sudden without
giving offence. There's the interests of the firm to consider, and it's
not for me to take a lower place than I'm given. But it's only for a
night or two, and you don't really suppose I wouldn't rather be where
you are if I was free to choose&mdash;but I'm <i>not</i>, <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, that's the worst
of it!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Well, go back to the Drawing Room, then; don't keep Lady <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>
waiting for her liniment on my account. I ought to be in my ladies'
rooms by this time. Only don't be surprised if, whenever you <i>are</i> free
to choose, you find you've come back just too late&mdash;that's all!</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>She
turns to leave him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>detaining her</i>). <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, I won't let you go like this! Not
before you've told me where I can meet you again here.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> There's no place that I know of&mdash;except the Housekeeper's Room;
and of course you couldn't descend so low as that.... <span class="smcap">James</span>, there's
somebody coming! Let go my hand&mdash;do you want to lose me my character!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[<i>Steps and voices are heard at the other end of the passage; she frees
herself, and escapes.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>attempting to follow</i>). But, <span class="smcap">Emma</span>, stop one&mdash;&mdash; She's
gone!... Confound it, there's the butler and a page-boy coming! It's no
use staying up here any longer. (<i>To himself, as he goes downstairs.</i>)
It's downright <i>torture</i>&mdash;that's what it is! To be tied by the leg in
the Drawing-Room, doing the civil to a lot of girls I don't care a blow
about; and to know that all the time some blarneying beggar downstairs
is doing his best to rob me of my <span class="smcap">Emma</span>! Flesh and blood can't stand it;
and yet I'm blest if I see any way out of it without offending 'em all
round.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>He enters the Chinese-Drawing-Room.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXVII.</span>&mdash;<i>The Chinese Drawing Room.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Spelwane.</i> At last, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>! We began to think you meant to
keep away altogether. Has anybody told you <i>why</i> you've been waited for
so impatiently?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>looking round the circle of chairs apprehensively</i>). No. Is
it family prayers, or what? Er&mdash;are they over?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> No, no; nothing of that &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. Can't you <i>guess</i>? Mr.
<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I'm going to be very bold, and ask a great, <i>great</i> favour of
you, I don't know why they chose <i>me</i> to represent them; I told Lady
<span class="smcap">Lullington</span> I was afraid my entreaties would have no weight; but if you
only would&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). They're at it again! How many <i>more</i> of 'em
want a pup! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Sorry to be disobliging, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> (<i>joining her hands in supplication</i>). Not if I <i>implore</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> you?
Oh, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I've quite set my heart on hearing you read aloud to
us. Are you really cruel enough to refuse?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Read aloud! Is <i>that</i> what you want me to do? But I'm no
particular hand at it. I don't know that I've ever read aloud&mdash;except a
bit out of the paper now and then&mdash;since I was a boy at school!</p>

<p><i>Lady Cantire.</i> <i>What's</i> that I hear? Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> professing incapacity
to read aloud? Sheer affectation! Come, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I am much mistaken
if you are wanting in the power to thrill all hearts here. Think of us
as instruments ready to respond to your touch. Play upon us as you will;
but don't be so ungracious as to raise any further obstacles.</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>resignedly</i>). Oh, very well, if I'm required to read, <i>I</i>'m
agreeable.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Murmurs of satisfaction.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Cant.</i> Hush, please, everybody! Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> is going to read. My
dear Dr. <span class="smcap">Rodney</span>, if you <i>wouldn't</i> mind just&mdash;&mdash; Lord <span class="smcap">Lullington</span>, can
you hear where you are? Where are you going to sit, Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>? In the
centre will be best. Will somebody move that lamp a little, so as to
give him more light?</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>to himself, as he sits down</i>). I wonder what we're supposed
to be playing at! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, what am I to read, eh?</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> (<i>placing an open copy of "Andromeda" in his hands with a
charming air of deferential dictation</i>). You might begin with
<i>this</i>&mdash;such a <i>dear</i> little piece! I'm dying to hear <i>you</i> read it!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> (<i>as he takes the book</i>). I'll do the best I can! (<i>He looks at
the page in dismay.</i>) Why, look here, it's <i>Poetry</i>! I didn't bargain
for that. Poetry's altogether out of my line! (Miss <span class="smcap">Spelwane</span> <i>opens her
eyes to their fullest extent, and retires a few paces from him; he turns
over the leaves backwards until he arrives at the title-page</i>.) I say,
this is rather curious! Who the dickins is <span class="smcap">Clarion Blair</span>? (<i>The company
look at one another with raised eyebrows and dropped underlips.</i>)
Because I never heard of him; but he seems to have been writing poetry
about my bull-dog.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spelw.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Writing poetry&mdash;about your bull-dog!</p>

<p><i>Spurr.</i> Yes, the one you've all been praising up so. If it isn't meant
for her, it's what you might call a most surprising coincidence, for
here's the old dog's name as plain as it can be&mdash;<i>Andromeda</i>!</p>

<p>The Downey ones, meaning thereby the photographers W. &amp; D. "of that
ilk," have produced some excellent photographic portraits in their fifth
series recently published. <span class="smcap">The Czarevich</span> and The Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Henry
Chaplin</span>, M.P., two sporting names well brought together, and both
capital likenesses, though the Baron fancies that <span class="smcap">The Czarevich</span> has the
best of it, for secret and silent as Mr. <span class="smcap">Chaplin</span> is as a politician, yet
did he never manage to keep so dark as he is represented in this
picture. Here, too, is Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Santley</span>&mdash;"<i>Charles our
friend</i>"&mdash;looking like a mere boy with "a singing face," where "Nature,
smiling, gave the winning grace." Mr. <span class="smcap">Sydney Grundy</span>, <i>endimanché</i>, is
too beautiful for words. But the picture of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bancroft</span>, wearing (in
addition to a trimmed fur cloak) a wonderful kind of "Fellah!
don't-know-yar-fellah!" expression, at once surprised, pained, and hurt,
does not at all represent the "little Mrs. B." whom the public knows and
loves. "How doth the little busy Mrs. B. delight to bark and bite" might
have been under this portrait, and <span class="smcap">Downey</span> must be more Downey another
time, and give us a more characteristic presentment of this lively
<i>comédienne</i>. The Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Arthur J. Balfour</span> is the best of all.
Capital. Just the man: "frosty but kindly." Then there is a first rate
portrait of Miss <span class="smcap">Fanny Brough</span>, and <i>after her</i> comes the King of
<span class="smcap">Saxony</span>!! O <span class="smcap">Albert</span> of Saxony! after Miss <span class="smcap">Fanny Brough</span>!! What'll Queenie

<p class="center"><i>Showman Joe soliloquiseth:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Waxworks indeed! Hah! I've took over the management of 'em, and I
suppose, as <i>Misther Thleary</i> said, I must "make the betht of 'em, not
the wurtht." But I'm a bit tired of the job&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p>Wish I could feel <i>Mrs. Jarley's</i> pride in the whole bag o' tricks! 'Ave
to <i>purtend</i> to, of course. Can't cry creaky waxworks any more than you
can stinking fish. But a more rusty, sluggish, wheezy, wobbly, jerky,
uncertain, stick-fast, stodgy, unwillin' lot o' wax figgers I never
did&mdash;&mdash;Well, there, it tries a conscience of injy-rubber to crack 'em up
and patter of 'em into poppylarity, blowed if it don't!</p>

<p>Kim up, Dook! Dashed if 'e don't look as if 'e fancied hisself the
Sleepin' Beauty, and wanted to forty-wink it for another centry. Look at
the flabby flop of 'im! Jest as though 'e wouldn't move if 'is nose wos
a meltin'. Large as life, and twice as nateral? Wy, a kid's Guy Fox on
the fifth o' November 'ud give 'im hodds, and lick 'is 'ead orf&mdash;heasy!
Bin a-ileing 'is works this ever so long, and still 'e moves as if 'is
wittles wos sand-paper, and 'is drink witrol. <i>Kim</i> up!</p>

<p>As to the Markis, well, 'e's a bit older, but dashed if 'e don't move
livelier&mdash;when 'e <i>is</i> on the shift. At the present moment 'owever,
utter confloption is a cycle-sprinter to 'im. As if a pair o'
niddity-noddities in "negative" positions was likely to fetch 'em in
front in <i>these</i> days! Yah!</p>

<p>Should like to keep the Old Show a-runnin', too,&mdash;leastways, until I can
start a bran-new one of my very own. Won't run to it <i>yet</i>, I'm afraid.
Oh, to boss a big booth-full all to myself! I'd show 'em! This
Combination Show&mdash;old stock-in-trade of one company, and cast-offs from
another&mdash;ain't the best o' bisness arter all. But I <i>must</i> keep 'em
together as a going concern till I can run a star company of my own
choosing. 'Ere, 'and us that ile-can again! Talk about rust and rickets!</p>

<p>Curting about to be rung up? Then I must get 'em in working horder
somehow! 'Ang this Dook! Can't git anythink nateral out of 'im&mdash;'cept a
yawn. <i>That</i> 'e does as like as life. Kim up old nose-o'-wax and don't
nod yerself into nothingness! 'Ow much <i>more</i> ile do yer rusty old
innards want to stop their clogging and creaking?</p>

<p>Proprietors beginning to pull long faces at my <i>pace</i>? 'Int that I'll
shake the machinery to smithereens by too much haction? Well, I <i>am</i>
blowed! Wy, they'd slow down a sick snail, and 'andicap a old tortus,
they would! Tell yer wot it is, if they don't give me a free 'and at the

slow-going stick-in-the-muds, <i>I</i> shall jest resign <i>my</i> responserble

both those works, written anything so powerful, so artistic, so

talent of interesting his reader as much in the action of his crowds as
he does in the fortunes of his individuals. He is the Sir <span class="smcap">John Gilbert</span>

Rotha</i> is not so very far off <i>Ivanhoe</i>. To compare with the works of

the Baron freely admits, "is saying a good deal,&mdash;<i>Treasure Island</i>

<p>The Baron anticipates "Next please," with pleasure, but at the
same time he would draw the attention of the prolific author to the
ancient proverb "<i>festina lente</i>," which is not at variance with his

<h2>POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>[On hearing that an Archdeacon had withdrawn from the School-Board
Controversy because he found himself opposed to his Bishop.]</p></blockquote>

<p>The Archdeacon is "sorry he spoke." Not that he has changed his
opinion&mdash;oh dear no! far from that. But the Bishop thinks otherwise, so
the Archdeacon retires as gracefully as may be from the controversy. He
is, he explains, as it were, the Bishop's "oculus"&mdash;the man to whom the
Bishop can proudly point, and say "All my eye!" This theory of
subordination of thought to one's superior is highly suggestive. For
instance, who will be surprised to read the following highly authentic
document, now made public for the first time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>To the Editor of the Once a-Month Review.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;With reference to my article "Is Horse-racing Justifiable?" I
desire to make known that while I still strongly adhere to my views
therein expressed as to the wickedness of the turf, I shall, for the
reason I am about to mention, take no further active part in the
controversy. I find that the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> is the owner of some
racehorses (a fact previously unknown to me), and as I am his "dextera,"
if it is not presumptive to say so, it would clearly be unbecoming on my
part to take up any antagonistic position. However much I may regret
having to take this course, I am sure you will agree with me that it is
the only one which is open to me.</p>

put on my most attractive bonnet, and an absolutely bewitching jacket,
when I discovered that <span class="smcap">Jim</span> (he's my husband, you know) did not intend to
go out. As I had read a little while before the new archidiaconal theory
of obedience, that of course prevented my going out. Clearly as I am
<span class="smcap">Jim's</span> "better-half" I couldn't go anywhere that <i>he</i> didn't go. Please,
<i>Mr. Punch</i>, was I right? Or can it be that the archdeacon was wrong?</p>

<h2>A PHALSE NOTE ON GEORGE THE FOURTH.</h2>

</div>

<p>Nay, but it is useless to protest. Much bosh and bauble-tit and
pop-limbo has been talked about <span class="smcap">George THE Phorth</span>. <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> denunciated
him in his charming style (we never find <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> searching for the
<i>mot juste</i> as for a wisp of hay in a packet of needles), but inverideed
he was not sufficiently merciful to the last gentleman in Europe. We
must not judge a prince too harshly. How many temptations he had with
all the wits and flutterpates and malaperts gyring and gimbling round
him! <span class="smcap">George</span> was a sportsman. He would spend the morning with his valet
(who was a hero to him), assuming gorgeous apparel, and tricking
himself, with brush and pigment, into more charm. He was implected with
a passion for the pleasures of the wardrobe, and had a Royal memory for
old coats. Then he would saunter into <span class="smcap">White's</span> for ale and tittle-tattle,
and drive a friend into the country, stopping on the way for <i>cursory</i>
visits at the taverns; I mean, swearing if the ale was not good. He had
his troubles. Queen <span class="smcap">Caroline</span> was a mimsy, out-moded woman, a sly serio,
who gadded hither and thither shrieking for the unbecoming. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Phox</span>
ensorcelled <span class="smcap">George</span> with her beautiful, silly phace, shadowed with
vermeil tinct and trimly pencilled. There was no secernment between her
soul and surface; she was mere, <i>insouciant</i>, with a rare dulcedo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George</span> collected locks of hair and what not, and what <i>not</i>. He gave in
his bright flamboyance a passing renascence to Society. But the
Victorian era came soon, and angels rushed in where fools had not feared
to tread, and hung the land with reps, and drove Artifice phorth, and
set <span class="smcap">Martin Tupper</span> on a throne of mahogany to rule over them.</p>

<p>In the tangled accrescency of <span class="smcap">George's</span> degringolade&mdash;in fact when he was
dyeing&mdash;he thought he had led the charge of Waterloo! Tristfully he
would describe the scene, referring to the Duke of <span class="smcap">Wellington</span> for
corroboration. An unfortunate slip, for it is well known the old soldier
was never there himself.</p>

<p>It is brillig, and from my window at the Métropole, Brighton, I see the
trite lawns and cheeky minarets of the Pavilion. I can see the rooms
crusted with ormolu, the fauns foisted on the ceiling, the ripping
rident goddesses on the walls. Once I phancied I saw a swaying phigure,
and a wine-red phace....</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I like to phancy the watchful evil phaces of my Criticks as they
read this article. Phair men, but infelix, they will lavish their anger
in epigramme. Not that I care a little tittle about adverse remarks
kicked from a gutter into a garret! But! But let them not outgribe too
soon, but rather dance and be glad, and trip the cockawhoop. For! For,
slithy toves as they are, they will read it with tears and desiderium,
unless I do as did <span class="smcap">Artemus</span> of shameful memory, and in jolliness and glad
indulgence whisper to them&mdash;</p>

<p><i>At Lugano.</i>&mdash;Geographically this seems to be Italy. But people remind
one always of the artificial frontier which makes it Switzerland. What's
that matter? Get up early. Ha! there it is. Cloudless sky! And such a
blue! Ultramarine at a guinea the thimbleful. Hurry down to enjoy its
beauty as long as possible. Fortunate I did so, for by ten o'clock it
has all vanished. Go up a hill. View from top would be fairly clear for
Helvellyn. But for Italy! Amiable and chatty Italian reminds me that I
am not in Italy. Ah, of course not. Will get there as soon as I can.
Meanwhile mope in hotel, for it is now raining steadily. Not a
magnificent mountain downpour, with thunder and lightning, howling of
wind, crashing of elements, alarums and excursions, and that sort of
thing; only a quiet, steady rain, which would be disliked even in
Ambleside. But in Ambleside there would be a fire. Here I sit in a
draughty, chilly corridor, with some melancholy Germans, all of us
wearing overcoats indoors. They remind me that I am not in Italy. Anyone
could see that.</p>

<p><i>At Pallanza.</i>&mdash;Here on Lago Maggiore there must really be the <span class="smcap">Rowbotham</span>
effects. My room looks over the lake. "<i>La vista è bellissima</i>," says
the waiter in the evening. Hooray! Now to forget the gloom of
Switzerland and England. Wake early. Misty morning. Good sign of fine
weather probably. Into bed again. Wake again. Only half-past seven.
Still misty. Into bed again. Wake once more. Still misty. Evidently
quite early. Hullo! still half-past seven. Watch stopped. Ring. "<i>Si,
Signore</i>," says the chambermaid, in the mixed dialect which she has
invented for foreigners, "<i>il est dieci heures</i>." Ten! By Jove! With
that fog? She assures me it will clear away, "<i>se non oggi, domani</i>."
<i>Bellissima vista</i> looks exactly like Derwentwater in rain. Grey water,
grey sky, grey mountains, wreathed in grey mist. It does not clear
to-day, so it may to-morrow.</p>

<p>Next day even worse. Fog greyer, and rain with it. Mud everywhere.
Notice a practical German tourist with three umbrellas strapped on his
knapsack. Wise man! He knows this climate, and also the advantage of a
change of clothes, or of umbrellas. So useful to have a morning
umbrella, an afternoon umbrella, and a sort of evening-dress umbrella to
bring down to the <i>table d'hôte</i>. When tired of gazing at the mist, I
read a three days old <i>Times</i>, preserved in the reading-room. Hullo!
what is that sound? A piano-organ! Heavens! To think that I should have
travelled hundreds of miles from London to hear the grinding of an organ
while I read the <i>Times</i> in a fog! Why, in Kensington Gardens I could
have done as much.</p>
